Development To-Do List
1. Main Priority
    Save file data.

    Try Chi2 step finding.

    Toggle speed calculation and rev_window input.

    Check transient pauses paper for pause detection.

2. Other Ideas
    Investigate anisotropy vs total intensity (normalize XYZ to [-1, 1]).

    Dynamic Threshold Trigger for ref cycle update:
        Trigger update if phase error or distance exceeds threshold.

    Backward penalty for indices more than one or two units away?
