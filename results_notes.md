file: Terrible PCA, might need to increase laser intensity.
file1: Good PCA, might be double speed. Speed did not come back after 80 mM buffer re-added.
file2: Need to treat ref cycle more carefully to deal with the stage moving when changing buffers. But probably not worth the time given the laser damage. Good trace but speed did not come back after 80 mM buffer re-added.
file3: Terrible PCA data. Might need to increase laser intensity next time and try segmented PCA.
